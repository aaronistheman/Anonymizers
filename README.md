# Packet Anonymizer

This is a small but flexible setup for creating packet anonymizers and includes anonymizers of the following types:

- Black-marker (where you get to provide the source and destination IPs).
- Random.
- Random with flow preservation.

Requires PcapPlusPlus. You can read more about this library [here](https://pcapplusplus.github.io/).
